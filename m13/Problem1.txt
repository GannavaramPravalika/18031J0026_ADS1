1)Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E (where a letter means insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially empty priority queue. Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.


P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E 

P
